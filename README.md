## üîç Abstract
This research presents a **Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA)** designed for **high gain** and **wide impedance bandwidth** targeted at **5G wireless applications**.  
The antenna operates in a higher-order TEx‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖŒ¥ mode and incorporates a **hollow cylindrical core** to lower the quality factor (Q) and thus broaden the bandwidth.  
Simulation and fabrication were performed using **CST Microwave Studio (CST MWS)** and experimentally validated using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).

## üìà Results & Analysis
| Parameter | DRA1 | DRA2 |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Bandwidth (‚àí10 dB) | 10.7 % | 16.1 % |
| Gain | 10.4 dBi | 10.4 dBi |
| Radiation Efficiency | 95 % | 96 % |
| Half-Power Beam Width (H-plane) | 49.2¬∞ | 54.1¬∞ |
| Polarization | Linear | Linear |

The **hollow cylindrical core** reduced the antenna‚Äôs radiation Q-factor, widening the impedance bandwidth while maintaining high gain and efficiency.  
The **simulated and measured** reflection coefficients, gain, and radiation patterns were in **strong agreement**, confirming design accuracy.
